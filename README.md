# Computer Graphics Project using C++

This project is a **menu-driven Computer Graphics application** implemented in **C++ using the BGI graphics library (graphics.h)**. It demonstrates fundamental **drawing algorithms** and **2D geometric transformations**, commonly used in academic Computer Graphics courses.

## Features

### Drawing Algorithms
- Line Drawing
  - DDA Algorithm
  - Bresenham’s Line Algorithm
  - Built-in `line()` function
- Circle Drawing
  - Bresenham’s Circle Algorithm
  - Midpoint Circle Algorithm
  - Built-in `circle()` function
- Ellipse Drawing
  - Midpoint Ellipse Algorithm
  - Built-in `ellipse()` function
- Shapes
  - Rectangle
  - Triangle

### 2D Transformations
- Translation
- Scaling
- Rotation

Transformations can be applied to all supported shapes through interactive menus.

## Concepts Covered
- Raster graphics algorithms
- Incremental plotting techniques
- Symmetry in circles and ellipses
- Coordinate-based transformations
- Menu-driven graphics programming

---

## Requirements
- Turbo C++ Compiler
- BGI Graphics Library
- DOSBox (recommended for modern systems)

---

## How to Run
1. Place `project.cpp` inside the `BIN` folder of Turbo C++.
2. Ensure the `BGI` folder path is correctly set.
3. Compile using `Alt + F9`.
4. Run using `Ctrl + F9`.

## File Structure

---

## Notes
- Uses legacy `graphics.h`, compatible with Turbo C++ only.
- Intended for educational and academic purposes.
